## Overview
This project involves two separate Python scripts, PyBank and PyPoll, designed to analyze financial records and election data, respectively. The goal is to provide insightful summaries and reports based on the provided datasets.

## PyBank

The PyBank script analyzes financial records stored in budget_data.csv, which contains monthly profit and loss data. The script calculates and outputs the following metrics:

- Total number of months included in the dataset.
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).
## PyPoll

The PyPoll script analyzes election data stored in election_data.csv, which contains voter IDs, counties, and candidate names. The script calculates and outputs the following metrics:

- Total number of votes cast.
- A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- Percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
## Conclusion
This project showcases basic data analysis and reporting using Python, focusing on reading data from CSV files, performing calculations, and generating formatted output. It provides a foundation for more complex data analysis projects.
